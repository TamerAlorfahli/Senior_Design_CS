# Tamer Capstone Assessment
My design project aims to solve a common problem that I have both noticed other people having and encountered myself and still do. I am hungry and want to eat but don't know what to eat, what to cook, or how to cook it. Using software to solve small problems like this while not complicated is aimed to improve quality of life by finding unique dishes to eat without looking for something specific. This helps give a broader range of cuisine to cook and try everday avoiding cooking the same thing everyday or ordering out. Also avoiding the hassle of finding recipes and ingredients should you need them which would be gathered into a shopping cart and purchased with a click of a button. With a emphasis on making the application as simple and user friendly as possible, as even the best application if not enjoyable to use can outweigh the pro's in my opinion.
