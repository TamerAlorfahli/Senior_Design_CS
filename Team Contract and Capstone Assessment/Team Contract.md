# Team Contract

### Members
* Tamer Alorfahli (Computer Science)

### Project Focus
I aim to create a application to provide users who are unsure of what to eat a vast assortment of unique dish ideas, recipes, and ingredient shopping, and meal planning in a single easy to use application. With my top four priorities being finding dishes and recipes, shopping for the ingredients, no fees and a great User experience/interface.

### Roles
Since this is a one person team I will be doing all the designing, developing, documentation, testing, and research.
