## Abstract: 
I plan to create a application that is able to streamline the process of determining what to eat and cooking. The application helps the user determine what to cook and provide recipes to them with a more robust database of selections. As well as potentially adding a feature to help the user source their ingredients for the recipes via the application and grocery shopping. 
## Project Description:
Everyone has had moments where you're hungry but don't know what to eat, or open the fridge and don't know what to cook. This application should make finding out what to eat a lot easier by providing unique options with recipes, what you need to cook them, how to cook them, shop for the ingredients, and plan your meals for you. With many apps in the health, fitness and cooking industry being either blocked by a expensive pay wall, not being designed well, or just not having enough options this aims to serve as an alternative. Using various algorithims, API's, Databases in a clean and easy to use interface with many food options. This should promote a healthier lifestyle and providing an alternative to fast food by making the whole process of determining what to eat, getting the groceries, cooking and getting food on the table and to your mouth effortless, instead of sitting wondering what to eat.
