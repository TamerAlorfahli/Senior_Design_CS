# Test Plan and Results
I will be doing testing the backend components of the software and checking their implementation. I want to make sure the tests can produce the same expected results repeatedly. I will also be testing the front-end components to verify that all components are working properly. These tests will be done in a local version of the program as well as a production deployed version.
