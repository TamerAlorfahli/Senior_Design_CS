# Potential Constraints
### The 3 main constraints that could impede the development of this project would most likely be:
* Economic
* Legal
* Security

### Economic
Economically speaking the cost of development could potentially be an issue, with a goal of trying to have as little spent on the development as possible. The cost of designing the application in terms of UI/UX could be an issue as many quality design software are pricey, and are usually monthly subscriptions which can rack up prices with the various design tools used over the course of the projects development. Some other factors to take into account or potentially scaling the project, buying cloud server to allow constant uptime, paying for API keys and other small transactions add up. with this being on a student budget that will be personally financed avoiding as many costs without sacrificing time, effort, and quality is the goal.

### Legal
The second would be possible legal constraints while this is highly unlikely, recipes could be considered intellectual property and without crediting or getting permission to use them could be more effort than what it is worth. As well as depending on how the project is built using various tools and code used, possibly having a similar design to the other meal plan applications may be considered unfair use of intellectual property if not credited or modified correctly.

### Security
The third would be security and encryption for the application. As attempting to add a feature to purchase the ingredients used in the recipes and paying from the app, it may contain sensitive information. If not developed correctly using API's or not encrypted properly when creating the payment processor sensitive data could be leaked or vulnerable to theft. This would be the biggest issue as user data policies have gotten much stricter and could end up having serious legal repercussions.
